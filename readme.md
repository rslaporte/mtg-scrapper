# MTG Scrapper

This scrapper was configured to automatically obtain the price of cards from the "Urza's Saga" block of the Magic the Gathering game on a daily basis. 
The script was implemented to scrape the Liga Magic website, taking the 8 lowest values ​​of each card, using tools such as Playwright and Pytesseract (OCR). The cards were listed using the Scryfall public API. 
This project is for personal study purposes only and has no profit motive or intention.
